# Trie
The trie (pronounced like "try," even though it is derived from re**trie**val) data structure is a tree structure used for storing strings. Each node in the tree has 26 children, one for each letter of the alphabet. It also contains a flag indicating whether the node is the end of a word.

A trie is efficient for storing strings that have a common prefix. For example, the words A, AN, and AND would be stored in a trie that looks like this:
